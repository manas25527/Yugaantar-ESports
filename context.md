# Yugaantar 2026 Esports · Project Context

Running log for the esports site. Update the **Status** and **Changelog** sections as work happens.

## Multi-game platform (from 5 Nov 2026)

The site now runs every Yugaantar esports event: CODM, Valorant, BGMI, Free Fire MAX, Smash Karts and FIFA. Rule docs for each are in `docs/`; each game's facts are in `src/games/registry.ts`.

- **Two shapes, two engines.** Head-to-head games (CODM, Valorant, FIFA) keep the CODM engine (`src/lib/tournament.ts`) and tables, now tagged with `game_id`; brackets of any size with byes come from `src/lib/knockout.ts`. Lobby games (Free Fire, BGMI, Smash Karts) use `lobby_*` tables and `src/lib/lobby/` (points tables, ordered tiebreakers, advancement rules, fixed or reshuffled lobbies). Solo games register each player as a team of one.
- **Registrations** come from the Unstop sheet (one tab per game, two header rows) through `src/lib/sync/`, every 5 minutes via `/api/sync` (Supabase cron) or *Sync now*. Teams match by name, players by email; nothing is deleted.
- **Logins:** only team leaders and solo players (Unstop role *Leader*), plus staff. One login can lead teams in several games. Staff can be limited to games (`staff.games`).
- **Branches:** `main` = this platform; `sheets` = display-only version read from sheets; `backend` = the CODM-only version before the rebuild.
- **Cache Components gotcha:** game routes must read `params` inside `<Suspense>`. After a tag invalidation Next re-renders the generic `/[game]` shell, and awaiting params outside Suspense there made every game page 500 until the next deploy. Fixed in `19928ec`; `next build` does not catch it, so check with `next start` after a publish.

### Open questions (multi-game)
- **Free Fire points and tiebreakers:** the 84/104-team rulebooks say 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 and kills → Clash Squad decider; the 17–23 Nov operations plan says 12-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 and Booyahs → kills → latest match. The site defaults to the operations plan (latest doc); change per stage in admin if needed.
- **Free Fire team count:** 84 vs 104 team docs, and the ops plan's 9 groups (5 × 12, 4 × 11). The draw makes as few lobbies of ≤12 as fit, so 104 teams → 9 lobbies automatically.
- **Free Fire weekend start:** the ops plan moves Sat 21 and Sun 22 to 9:30 PM. The draw uses 8:30 PM for every evening; move those lobbies' times by redrawing that evening or editing them.
- **BGMI:** the SOP reshuffles groups after every match, but the BGMI schedule plays half the groups on 17 Nov and half on 18 Nov. Reshuffling needs everyone on the same evening; the site plays the whole qualifier on one evening by default. The SOP's tiebreakers (finishes first) also differ from the BGMI doc's (chicken dinners first); the site uses the BGMI doc.
- **Valorant:** BO3 or BO1 offline (two docs). No seeding rule, so the bracket is a random draw; the admin can seed instead.
- **Smash Karts:** registration closes 27 Nov but rounds 1–2 are "online"; dates are needed.
- **FIFA:** no rules document yet. Set up as a solo knockout, BO1.
- **Privacy:** the registrations sheet is public ("anyone with the link"), exposing names, emails and phones. Share it with a service account instead and set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.

# CODM Carnage 2.0 — Rift Ops

- Event: Yugaantar 2026 (Theme: Game Verse) presents CODM Carnage 2.0 — Rift Ops
- Rulebook: `docs/rulebook.pdf` (copy served at `/rulebook.pdf`)
- Repo: https://github.com/SamarthPD-21/CODM (`main` and `backend` pushed)
- Rules source: **only** `docs/rulebook.pdf`, plus the organisers' *Tournament Format & Schedule* doc (`docs/format-and-schedule.docx`, 30 Oct 2026) for format, dates, tiebreakers and seeding. Where both are silent, it's listed under open questions instead of borrowing outside conventions.
- Online window: **8–10 PM IST**, about **5 referees**, so 5 lobbies at once (organiser, 2 Nov). This replaces the doc's 6 PM–10:30 PM slot table.
- Hosting: Vercel

## Branch plan

| Branch | What it is | State |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Public site. No database or login. Data is filled and tallied by hand in a **Google Sheet**. | Done and pushed (`aa2dfbe`) |
| `backend` | Same site plus a database, logins, player dashboards and a referee/admin panel. | Built and tested end to end against local Supabase; pushed |

**Rule shared by both branches:** they use the same `src/lib/types.ts` and the same UI components. Only `src/lib/data.ts` changes (Sheet → Postgres). Nobody types standings or bracket results; they are always computed from map scores.

---

## Decisions made

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16.4 (App Router, `cacheComponents` + `partialPrefetching`), Tailwind v4 |
| Static data source | Google Sheet shared as "Anyone with link → Viewer", read as CSV through the gviz endpoint |
| Freshness | `'use cache'` + custom `cacheLife('sheet')` (revalidates every 60 s). `POST /api/revalidate?secret=…` forces an immediate refresh |
| Group structure | **Not decided yet.** Built to be configurable (any number of groups, `qualifiers_per_group` in the Config tab). Sample data uses 4 groups × 4 teams with the top 2 advancing |
| Points | 1 point per map won (rulebook §9) |
| Tiebreakers | Head-to-head → score diff → total score → coin toss (flagged ⚑ in the UI). The order can be changed in the Config tab |
| Seeding | Group winners first, then runners-up, each ordered by points, then diff, then score |
| SF Veto Power | Goes to the higher overall seed; shown as a `VETO` badge on SF cards |
| Hosting | Vercel |

---

## Architecture (main branch)

```
Google Sheet ──(CSV per tab)──► src/lib/sheet.ts      fetch + tab-header sanity check
                                src/lib/parse.ts      CSV → typed RawTournament (+ warnings)
                                src/lib/tournament.ts series scoring, standings, seeds, slot refs (pure, unit-tested)
                                src/lib/data.ts       getTournament(): 'use cache', falls back to sample data
                                        ▼
                     pages: / · /teams · /teams/[id] · /groups · /schedule · /bracket · /rules
```

Other files:
- `src/content/event.ts`: fixed rulebook content (prizes, stage formats, penalties, banned items)
- `src/lib/sample-data.ts`: 16-team placeholder tournament, built as CSV tabs so it runs through the real parser
- `src/components/*`: MatchCard, GroupTable, TeamBadge, StatusChip, Nav, Footer, UpNext (client-side countdown)

### Scripts
- `npm test`: engine and parser unit tests (`node --test`, 8 passing)
- `npm run check-sheet`: fetches the live sheet and prints standings and every data problem (needs `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in `.env.local`)
- `npm run export-template`: writes `sheet-template/*.csv` for importing into Google Sheets
- `npx next typegen`: run once before `tsc` if route types are missing

### Env vars (`.env.example`)
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`: empty means sample data, and a "Preview mode" banner shows
- `REVALIDATE_SECRET`

---

## Google Sheet schema (tab names must match exactly)

| Tab | Columns |
|---|---|
| Teams | team_id, name, tag, group, logo_url, captain |
| Players | team_id, ign, codm_uid, role (main/sub) |
| Matches | match_id, stage (group/qf/sf/third/final), group, round, best_of, team_a, team_b, date (YYYY-MM-DD or DD/MM/YYYY), time (18:00 or 6:00 PM, IST), status (blank, or live/forfeit/cancelled), forfeit_winner (A/B/team_id), veto_note, notes |
| Maps | match_id, game, mode (HP/SND/CTRL), map, score_a, score_b |
| Config | key, value (qualifiers_per_group, tiebreakers, perspective, event_dates, registration_deadline, registration_url) |
| Announcements | date, title, body |
| MapPool | mode, map |

Knockout `team_a`/`team_b` can be a slot reference instead of a team: `A1` (group A, 1st), `S3` (seed 3), `W:QF1` (winner of QF1), `L:SF2` (loser of SF2). These fill in automatically.

On match day, organisers only fill **Maps** rows. Match status, standings, seeds and the bracket are all derived from them.

Sheet gotchas:
- Set the whole sheet to **Format → Number → Plain text**. gviz drops values in columns with mixed types.
- Set the sheet locale to **India** so dates come out as DD/MM.
- A missing tab is detected (gviz would otherwise silently return the first tab).

## Status

**Done (backend)**
- Supabase schema and RLS: `supabase/migrations/20261026000000_init.sql`
- Seed generated from the sample data: `npm run seed-sql` / `npm run db:reset`
- Email magic-link login, limited to registered emails and staff, with no enumeration
- `/me` player dashboard: room release, check-in, history, mode stats, disputes, captain veto and sub reports
- `/admin`: matches, match editor (maps with pending/publish, room, check-in with late tiers, details, disputes), setup (CSV import, round-robin, bracket), content and staff
- Tests: 16 unit tests (engine, rulebook timing, fixtures) plus a 19-check browser test (scratchpad `e2e/flow.mjs`), all passing
- Public pages are still statically prerendered; staff writes call `updateTag("tournament")` so results appear immediately

**Backend decisions**
- Login: email magic link (Supabase Auth). Players claim their profile automatically when the login email matches `player_contacts.email`.
- Staff are keyed by email in the `staff` table (roles: referee or admin). Referee results are *pending* until an admin publishes them; an admin can publish directly.
- Public and service DB reads use a bare `PostgrestClient`, because supabase-js's auth bootstrap reads the clock and can't run inside `'use cache'`. `getViewer()` calls `connection()` first for the same reason.
- "Match end" for the 10-minute dispute window is the newest `maps.updated_at` for that match.

**Online group stage (backend)**, from rulebook §3.1, §3.2, §6, §7, §8.2, §12:

| Rule | How the site handles it |
|---|---|
| One decisive mode per match day | Admin → Content → "Group stage match days". Shown on /schedule and in players' dashboards; it is the default mode for that day's score entry and veto. Table `match_days`. |
| Check in 30 min before | Captain or any player taps "Check in my team" on /me (open from 60 min before to 15 min after match time), or the referee checks the team in. |
| Join lobby within 10 min of invite | Referee taps "Invite sent now" in the room panel, then "Joined" per team. Players see the join-by time. |
| Late penalty tiers | Worked out from whichever window was missed by more (check-in or lobby) and shown to the referee. Applying it is still a manual status override. |
| Room ID 15–5 min before | Released to both teams at T−15; the editor flags it as overdue from T−5. |
| BO1 veto Ban–Ban–Ban–Ban | Referee records who bans first, the coin-toss winner (picks side) and the 4 bans, plus a screenshot link. The site checks it against the 5-map pool, works out the map, writes the public veto note and pre-fills the map in score entry. Table `map_vetoes`. Players see the result on /me. |
| No tied maps (overtime) | Score entry rejects ties. |
| Disputes 10 min, ruling in 30 | Already built. |

**Backend: still to do**
- [x] Push the `backend` branch
- [ ] Create the hosted Supabase project, set custom SMTP (required for magic links at scale) and Vercel env vars (see README)
- [ ] Screenshot uploads go through links today; Supabase Storage upload is optional
- [ ] Realtime push for live scores (pages currently refresh on navigation; staff writes invalidate the cache instantly)
- [ ] Map score sanity checks per mode (e.g. HP 250 cap, S&D round counts)

**Done (main)**
- Data engine, parser and sample data, with 8 unit tests passing
- All 7 pages built in the Rift theme (dark, violet/cyan)
- `npm run build` passes and every page is static, revalidating every 1 minute
- Checked in headless Chromium: home, groups, bracket and mobile home look correct

**Not done / to verify**
- [x] Committed and pushed to GitHub (`main`)
- [ ] Connect a Vercel project and set env vars
- [ ] Create the real Google Sheet from `sheet-template/` and run `npm run check-sheet`
- [x] UpNext countdown verified (the earlier blank was just pre-hydration)
- [x] All pages screenshot-checked
- [x] 3rd-place match: confirmed by the format doc (BO3, Sun 29 Nov 11:30 AM). The bracket generator includes it by default.

## Open questions for organisers (the PDF and format doc don't say)
- **BO1 late tier "Forfeit first map/round":** in a one-map match, does this mean losing the match, or round 1 (S&D/Control only)? The site shows the tier; the referee applies it.
- **Group-stage "higher seed bans first":** there are no seeds during the group stage, so in practice it's the coin toss. Confirm.
- **Online check-in:** is a team's own "Check in" on the site acceptable as "checking in with the referee"? The referee can still check them in or undo it.
- **BO3/BO5 map veto:** the PDF says per mode, but a 6-step veto per mode needs 7 maps per mode. Knockout vetoes are free text for now.
- **3-way tiebreaker when two places are at stake:** the doc gives the bye to the team with most points won and says the final decides. If the bye team loses the final, who is 2nd: the final's loser or the semi's loser? The site ranks a team knocked out later higher (final loser 2nd). Confirm.
- **QF same-group swap for seed 8:** "the lower seed swaps with the next runner-up seed down" has no seed below 8. The site then swaps with the next one up (7, 6, 5), choosing the first that removes the clash.
- **Registration cap:** with 5 lobbies × 3 slots, Tue–Sat holds 75 matches. Up to **38 teams** fits. 39–48 teams spill into Sun 22 (the tiebreaker day), and 49+ (opening round) can't fit at all. Suggest capping registrations at **36** to leave slack for reschedules, or adding a 4th slot (start 7:20 PM).
- **Still to provide:** registration link, the group-stage map pool (5 per mode for the BO1 veto) and TPP/FPP. All are due Sun 15 Nov.
- **Doc slot table vs 8–10 PM:** the doc's capacity check (4 lobbies × 6 slots = 120 matches) no longer holds. Update the doc to the 3-slot evening below before it goes to teams.

---

## Backend branch plan (original; now implemented except the items above)

**Stack:** Next.js + Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage for screenshots), Drizzle or Prisma, on Vercel.

**Pipeline:**
1. **Registration:** Google Form or CSV, then admin "Import CSV", which creates Teams and Players.
2. **Accounts:** players claim their profile using the email from registration (magic link) or a one-time code. No open signup.
3. **Fixtures:** admin generates the group round robin. Knockout slots use the same slot refs as the sheet.
4. **Match day:** referee panel for check-in (late-penalty tier computed automatically), veto record, and room ID (shown only to the two teams, 15 minutes before the match).
5. **Results:** referee enters per-map scores plus a screenshot, which sets status to *pending*. A head referee approves it to *final*. A dispute puts it on hold (the 10-minute window is enforced).
6. **Derived data:** the same `tournament.ts` engine recomputes standings, seeds and the bracket.
7. **Surfaces:** the public site (same pages, now live) and a player dashboard (my team, next match with countdown, room ID, match history, map stats).

**Roles:** Public · Player · Captain (SF veto submission, sub swap ≥10 min before) · Referee · Admin.

## Login (code + confirm page): done
- PKCE magic links fail if opened in a different browser (e.g. Gmail's in-app browser). College Microsoft 365 "Safe Links" scanners can use up the link before the student clicks it.
- Built:
  - The email (`supabase/templates/login.html`) carries a 6-digit code, typed on /login, plus a link to /auth/confirm.
  - That page only logs in on a "Continue" press, so a scanner opening the link doesn't use it up, and it works in any browser.
- Found and fixed while testing:
  - With `cacheComponents`, a form submitted before the page hydrates comes back blank. Submit buttons now stay disabled until hydration (`useHydrated`).
  - The login page used to swap a placeholder form for the real one while loading, which could eat a fast tap. It is now a single form.
- Before the event:
  - Custom SMTP is required. The built-in mailer only sends to the Supabase org's own members.
  - Raise the per-IP OTP limits (default 30 per 5 min).
  - The free-tier project pauses after 7 days idle.

## Format and timing (from the format doc + 8–10 PM window)
- Groups by registration count: ≤8 → 1 group (seeding only), 9–24 → 4 groups (top 2), 25–48 → 8 groups (winners). Always 8 qualifiers. Admin → Setup → "Draw groups" does the random draw (extras go to Group A first). Run it on the recorded call.
- Evenings: slots at **8:00, 8:40 and 9:20 PM** (40 min each: veto, lobby join ≤10 min, map, score entry). Check-in is 30 min before each slot, so the first check-in is 7:30 PM. 5 lobbies, ≤2 matches per team per day, a free slot between.
- Rounds go one per day while they fit, so groups of 4 play Tue/Wed/Thu = HP/S&D/Control, and groups of 5–6 use all five days. Fri/Sat are spare for 4-team groups.
- Modes: Tue HP · Wed S&D · Thu Control · Fri HP · Sat S&D. Sun 22 tiebreakers only. Seeded as match days in `seed.sql`; production admins set them under Content.
- Standings: wins → head-to-head → buffer-day tiebreaker matches (`stage = tiebreak`, they don't add wins) → recorded coin toss (`coin_toss` setting, e.g. `t03 > t07`). Only ties that affect qualifying or a qualifier's position are flagged.
- Seeds: winners 1–4, runners-up 5–8 (8 groups: winners ranked together), each by wins → points won → coin toss. QF pairs that would be two teams from one group get swapped.
- Offline: QFs Fri 27 (10:30, 12:30, 2:30, 4:30), SFs Sat 28 (11:00, 2:00), 3rd place Sun 29 11:30, Final 3:00 PM. "Generate bracket" sets these times.

| Teams | Groups | Matches | Evenings used (5 lobbies × 3 slots) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 1 × 8 | 28 | 5 (some days 2 per team) |
| 16 | 4 × 4 | 24 | 3 (8 a night, done by 9:20) |
| 24 | 4 × 6 | 60 | 5 (12 a night, done by 10:00) |
| 32 | 8 × 4 | 48 | 4 (15/15/15/3) |
| 36 | 8 × 4–5 | 64 | 5 |
| 38 | 8 × 4–5 | 72 | 5, full |
| 40 | 8 × 5 | 80 | spills 5 into Sunday |
| 48 | 8 × 6 | 120 | doesn't fit (45 over) |

## Visual design ("ops board")
- Asphalt `#1c1f22` and gunmetal surfaces, chalk text `#eceae4`, one accent: signal yellow `#f4c430`, used only for attention (primary buttons, the next-match countdown, live rail, qualifying rows, champion). Flare `#ff5436` for live/errors.
- Type: Big Shoulders Stencil for display, used only at 2xl and up; Barlow for body; Barlow Condensed for data, scores and small labels. No monospace.
- 3px corners, no gradients or glows. Match cards carry a left status rail. Headings have no tracked-caps eyebrows; a page's live fact (e.g. "19 of 32 played") sits opposite its title. Text links are chalk with an underline that turns yellow on hover.
- Custom primitives (`.panel`, `.rail`, `.link`, `.rift-line`) live in `@layer components` so Tailwind utilities can override them.

## Changelog
- **2026-11-06:** `sheets` branch built: display-only, rosters from the Unstop sheet and results from one results sheet (two tabs per game), no database or logins. Its privacy check against the real sheet found two players with an email typed as their IGN or a phone number as their game ID. The same filter now runs in `main`'s sync: those values are hidden and listed as issues (`contact_in_field`); a real sync left 0 email- or phone-like values in public fields. Lobby rooms, check-ins and disputes are now limited to that game's staff in RLS too.
- **2026-11-05/06:** Multi-game rebuild on branch `platform`, merged into `main`. Feature commits:
  - data model and game registry;
  - lobby points engine;
  - lobby data loader;
  - knockouts with byes;
  - event hub and per-game pages;
  - Unstop sync;
  - leader dashboard;
  - lobby control room, referee entry and leaderboards.

  Checked in the browser: real-sheet sync (all 6 tabs, idempotent), a Free Fire night end to end on a phone (create stages → fill → draw → enter → publish → public standings), the BGMI reshuffled draw, the Valorant 46-team bracket (18 byes, doc schedule), and leader dashboards. Fixed along the way:
  - ties across lobbies;
  - tie markers before play;
  - phone-width overflow;
  - bye walkovers listed as 0–0;
  - game pages failing after a publish in production.
  
  84 unit tests.
- **2026-11-03:** New visual identity replacing the violet-cyan gradient look (see "Visual design"). Fixed along the way: white text on primary buttons, `.panel` silently overriding border-colour utilities, and arrows lost from `.join()` separators during the sweep. Browser suites updated for the new copy and pass; README screenshots retaken.
- **2026-11-02 (later):** README rewritten with screenshots (`docs/screenshots/`, taken from the local stack in a staged match-day state). Fixed while reviewing them: tie flags showed on groups still in progress; "1 matches" on the schedule; a missing full stop on the dashboard; a truncated mode select in Content; the planner said "0 matches" once fixtures existed; the seed didn't set the registration deadline.
- **2026-11-02:** Applied the organisers' format doc and the 8–10 PM / 5-referee window. Standings: wins → h2h → tiebreaker matches → coin toss. Seeding sets and the same-group QF swap. Scheduler rewritten for fixed evening slots, with a per-team daily cap and spill detection. Group draw by registration count. Bracket at the offline times with the 3rd-place match. Key dates on home; schedule, standings and seeding sections on Rules. Sample data moved to 17–29 Nov. Found and fixed: admin forms were filled from the cached tournament, so saving after an out-of-band DB edit wrote old teams back; staff pages now read uncached. 30 unit tests. New browser suites (match day 13, format 15, draw/fixtures 9) pass on a fresh DB. Pushed `backend`.
- **2026-10-26 (night):**
  - Login by emailed code, plus a link page with a button.
  - Fixture generator now leaves per-team rest between matches, and setup shows a format preview.
  - Fixed: the blank page after a pre-hydration submit, and a lost tap on the login form.
  - All browser suites pass twice in a row: auth 9, flow 19, group stage 19.
- **2026-10-26 (evening):** Online group stage: match-day modes, BO1 veto recorder, lobby invite/join window, self check-in, room-overdue flag. Admin forms keep values after a rejected save. 4 new unit tests, a 19-check group-stage browser test, and the earlier 19 checks still pass. Pushed `backend`. Removed AI attribution from commit messages; `AGENTS.md` untracked.
- **2026-10-26 (later):** Pushed `main`. Built the `backend` branch with Supabase: schema and RLS, magic-link auth, player dashboard, referee/admin panel, CSV import, fixture and bracket generators. Fixed a dispute window that opened for future-dated results, and a clock read during runtime prefetch. Unit and e2e tests pass.
- **2026-10-26:** Project scaffolded (Next 16.4). Rulebook parsed. Planned two branches. Decided on Google Sheet for `main`, Vercel hosting, h2h-first tiebreak, configurable groups. Built the full static site with sample data. Build and tests pass. Paused before the first commit or push.
